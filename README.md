Spiderpool is a [CNCF Landscape Level Project](https://landscape.cncf.io/card-mode?category=cloud-native-network&grouping=category).

![CNCF](./docs/images/cncf-cloud-gophers-transparent.png)

## Introduction

Spiderpool is a Kubernetes underlay network solution. It provides rich IPAM features
and CNI integration capabilities, powering CNI projects in the open source community,
allowing multiple CNIs to collaborate effectively. It enables underlay CNI to run
perfectly in environments such as **bare metal, virtual machines, and any public cloud**.

Why developing Spiderpool? Currently, the open source community does not provide
comprehensive, friendly, and intelligent underlay network solutions, so Spiderpool
aims to provide many innovative features:

* Rich IPAM feature. Shared and dedicated IP pools, assigning fixed IP address,
  automatic operation of dedicated IP pools for creating, scaling, and reclaiming.
  It could match kinds of underlay network requirements.

* Underlay CNI and overlay CNI cooperation, multiple CNI interfaces for pod.
  Spiderpool helps assign IP address to multiple underlay interfaces, coordinate
  policy route between interfaces to ensure consistence data path of request and
  reply packets. Multiple CNIs cooperate to reduce hardware requirements for deploying the cluster.

* Enhance underlay CNI like [Macvlan CNI](https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/tree/main/plugins/main/macvlan),
  [ipvlan CNI](https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/tree/main/plugins/main/ipvlan),
  [SR-IOV CNI](https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/sriov-cni),
  [ovs CNI](https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/ovs-cni) to connect Pod and host to
  access clusterIP and check pod health, and to detect IP conflict and gateway accessibility.

* Not only limited to bare metal environments in data centers, but also providing
  a unified underlay CNI solution for OpenStack, VMware, and various public cloud scenarios.

## Underlay CNI

There are two technologies in cloud-native networking: "overlay network" and "underlay network".
Despite no strict definition for underlay and overlay networks in cloud-native networking, we
can simply abstract their characteristics from many CNI projects. The two technologies meet
the needs of different scenarios.

The [article](./docs/concepts/solution.md) provides a brief comparison of IPAM and
network performance between the two technologies, which offers better insights into
the unique features and use cases of Spiderpool.

Why underlay network solutions? The following requirements necessitate underlay network solutions:

* Network performance. Network performance advantages, like low latency, high throughput, low forwarding overhead of node’s CPU.  It fits to applications like financial and AI application.

* Transformation cost. The traditional host application has characteristic, like exposing service with host fixed IP, separating communication with different subnets. At the beginning of migrating to the kubernetes,  the underlay network solution spend low transformation cost of network, application can directly use Pod IP for cluster east-west and north-south communication.

* Network security. In the data center, it may be used to enforce network security to Pod, like firewall and isolating communication with VLAN.  The underlay network solution could expose the Pod packet without tunnel encapsulation, and meet requirements.

* Bandwitdth. It can help Pod to customize the exit network interface of the node, thereby ensuring bandwidth isolation of the underlying subnet. It can help components such as [kubevirt](https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt), storage, and logging, to transmit massive amounts of data.

* Multi clusters. For multi clusters, all Pods of multi clusters are connected to the underlay network, so they could communicate smoothly without the need to deploy additional components for cluster connectivity.

## Architecture

![arch](./docs/images/spiderpool-arch.jpg)

Spiderpool consists of the following components:

* Spiderpool controller: deployment that manage CRD validation, status updates,
  IP recovery, and automated IP pools

* Spiderpool agent: daemonset that help Spiderpool plugins by performing
  IP allocation and coordinator plugin for information synchronization.

* IPAM plugin: a binary plugin on each host that CNI can utilize to implement IP allocation.

* coordinator plugin: a binary plugin on each host that CNI can use for multi-NIC route coordination,
  IP conflict detection, and host connectivity.

* ifacer plugin: A binary plugin on each host that helps CNIs such as macvlan and
  ipvlan dynamically create bond and vlan interfaces

On top of its own components, Spiderpool relies on open-source underlay CNIs to allocate
network interfaces to Pods. You can use [Multus CNI](https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/multus-cni)
to manage multiple NICs and CNI configurations.

Any CNI project compatible with third-party IPAM plugins can work well with Spiderpool, such as:

[Macvlan CNI](https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/tree/main/plugins/main/macvlan),
[vlan CNI](https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/tree/main/plugins/main/vlan),
[ipvlan CNI](https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/tree/main/plugins/main/ipvlan),
[SR-IOV CNI](https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/sriov-cni),
[ovs CNI](https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/ovs-cni),
[Multus CNI](https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/multus-cni),
[Calico CNI](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico),
[Weave CNI](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave)

## Use case: underlay CNIs access layer2

![arch_underlay](./docs/images/spiderpool-underlay.jpg)

In underlay networks, Spiderpool can work with underlay CNIs such as
[Macvlan CNI](https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/tree/main/plugins/main/macvlan)
, [SR-IOV CNI](https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/sriov-cni), [ipvlan CNI](https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/tree/main/plugins/main/ipvlan) to provide the following benefits:

* Rich IPAM capabilities for underlay CNIs, including shared/fixed IPs, multi-NIC IP allocation,
  and dual-stack support

* One or more underlay NICs for Pods with coordinating routes between multiple NICs to
  ensure smooth communication with consistent request and reply data paths

* Enhanced connectivity between open-source underlay CNIs and hosts using additional
  veth network interfaces and route control. This enables clusterIP access, local health checks
  of applications, and much more

How can you deploy containers using a single underlay CNI, when a cluster has multiple underlying setups?

* Some nodes in the cluster are virtual machines like VMware that don't enable promiscuous mode,
  while others are bare metal and connected to traditional switch networks.
  What CNI solution should be deployed on each type of node?

* Some bare metal nodes only have one SR-IOV high-speed NIC that provides 64 VFs.
  How can more pods run on such a node?

* Some bare metal nodes have an SR-IOV high-speed NIC capable of running low-latency applications,
  while others have only ordinary network cards for running regular applications.
  What CNI solution should be deployed on each type of node?

By simultaneously deploying multiple underlay CNIs through Multus CNI configuration and
Spiderpool's IPAM abilities, resources from various infrastructure nodes across the
cluster can be integrated to solve these problems.

![underlay](./docs/images/underlay.jpg)

For example, as shown in the above diagram, different nodes with varying networking capabilities
in a cluster can use various underlay CNIs, such as SR-IOV CNI for nodes with SR-IOV network cards,
Macvlan CNI for nodes with ordinary network cards, and ipvlan CNI for nodes with restricted
network access (e.g., VMware virtual machines with limited layer 2 network forwarding).

## Use case: adding an auxiliary underlay CNI NIC for overlay CNI

![arch_underlay](./docs/images/spiderpool-overlay.jpg)

In overlay networks, Spiderpool uses Multus to add an overlay NIC
(such as [Calico](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico) or [Cilium](https://github.com/cilium/cilium))
and multiple underlay NICs (such as Macvlan CNI or SR-IOV CNI) for each Pod.
This offers several benefits:

* Rich IPAM features for underlay CNIs, including shared/fixed IPs,
 multi-NIC IP allocation, and dual-stack support.

* Route coordination for multiple underlay CNI NICs and an overlay NIC for Pods,
  ensuring the consistent request and reply data paths for smooth communication.

* Use the overlay NIC as the default one with route coordination and enable local host
  connectivity to enable clusterIP access, local health checks of applications, and
  forwarding overlay network traffic through overlay networks while forwarding
  underlay network traffic through underlay networks.

The integration of Multus CNI and Spiderpool IPAM enables the collaboration of
an overlay CNI and multiple underlay CNIs. For example, in clusters with nodes
of varying network capabilities, Pods on bare-metal nodes can access both
overlay and underlay NICs. Meanwhile, Pods on virtual machine nodes only
serving east-west services are connected to the Overlay NIC.
This approach provides several benefits:

* Applications providing east-west services can be restricted to being allocated
  only the overlay NIC while those providing north-south services can simultaneously
  access overlay and underlay NICs. This results in reduced Underlay IP resource usage,
  lower manual maintenance costs, and preserved pod connectivity within the cluster.

* Fully integrate resources from virtual machines and bare-metal nodes.

![overlay](./docs/images/overlay.jpg)

## Use case: underlay CNI on public cloud and VM

It is hard to implement underlay CNI in public cloud, OpenStack, VMware.
It requires the vendor underlay CNI on specific environments, as these
environments typically have the following limitations:

* The IAAS network infrastructure implements MAC restrictions for packets.
  On the one hand, security checks are conducted on the source MAC to ensure
  that the source MAC address is the same as the MAC address of VM network interface.
  On the other hand, restrictions have been placed on the destination MAC,
  which only supports packet forwarding by the MAC address of VM network interfaces.

  The MAC address of the Pod in the common CNI plugin is newly generated,
  which leads to Pod communication failure.

* The IAAS network infrastructure implements IP restrictions on packets.
  Only when the destination and source IP of the packet are assigned to VM,
  packet could be forwarded rightly.

  The common CNI plugin assigns IP addresses to Pods that do not comply with
  IAAS settings, which leads to Pod communication failure.

Spiderpool provides IP pool based on node topology, aligning with
IP allocation settings of VMs. In conjunction with ipvlan CNI,
it provides underlay CNI solutions for various public cloud environments.

## Use case: utilize RDMA for network transmission

RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access) allows network cards to directly interact with memory, reducing CPU overhead and alleviating the burden on the kernel protocol stack. This technology offloads the network protocol stack to the network card, resulting in effective reduction of network transmission latency and increased throughput.

Currently, RDMA finds extensive applications in fields such as AI computing and storage. Macvlan, IPvlan, and SR-IOV CNIs enable transparent RDMA network card passthrough to Pods within the Kubernetes platform. Spiderpool enhances these CNIs by providing additional capabilities including IPAM, host connectivity, clusterIP access, as well as simplifying the installation process and usage steps of dependent components in the community.

## Quick start

Refer to [Quick start](./docs/usage/install/install.md), set up a cluster quickly.

## Major features

* For applications requiring static IP addresses, it could be supported by
  IP pools owning limited IP adddress set and pod affinity.
  See [example](./docs/usage/ippool-affinity-pod.md) for more details.

    For applications not requiring static IP addresses, they can share an IP pool.
    See [example](./docs/usage/ippool-affinity-pod.md#shared-ippool) for more details.

* For stateful applications, IP addresses can be automatically fixed for each Pod,
  and the overall IP scaling range can be fixed as well.
  See [example](./docs/usage/statefulset.md) for more details.

* Subnet feature, on the one hand, could help to separate the responsibility
  from the infrastructure administrator and the application administrator.

    On the other hand, it supports to automatically create and dynamically scale
    the fixed IP ippools to each applcation requiring static IPs. which could help
    reduce operation burden of IP pools burden. See [example](./docs/usage/spider-subnet.md)
    for more details. In additional to kubernetes-native controller, subnet feature
    also supports third-party pod controllers based on operator.
    See [example](./docs/usage/third-party-controller.md) for details.

* For Pods of an application run across different network zones,
  it could assign IP addresses of different subnets.
  See [example](./docs/usage/ippool-affinity-node.md) for details.

* Support to assign IP address from different subnets to multiple NICs of a Pod,
  and help coordinate policy route between interfaces to ensure consistent
  data path of request and reply packets.

    For scenarios involving multiple Underlay NICs,
    please refer to the [example](./docs/usage/multi-interfaces-annotation.md).

    For scenarios involving one Overlay NIC and multiple Underlay NICs,
    please refer to the [example](./docs/usage/install/overlay/get-started-calico.md).

* It supports to set default IP pools for the cluster or for the namespace.
  Besides, A IP pool could be shared by the whole cluster or bound to a
  specified namespace. See [example](./docs/usage/ippool-affinity-namespace.md) for details.

* Strengthen CNI like [Macvlan CNI](https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/tree/main/plugins/main/macvlan),
  [ipvlan CNI](https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/tree/main/plugins/main/ipvlan),
  [SR-IOV CNI](https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/sriov-cni),
  [ovs CNI](https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/ovs-cni),
  to access clusterIP and pod healthy check ([example](./docs/usage/install/underlay/get-started-macvlan.md)),
  to detect IP conflict and gateway reachability ([example](./docs/usage/coordinator.md)).

* Node-based IP pool feature meets the complex subnet design of each node. refer to [example](./docs/usage/network-topology.md)

* On VMware vSphere platform, Spiderpool underlay network solution does not require ["hybrid forwarding" mode of the Vswitch](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/8.0/vsphere-security/GUID-3507432E-AFEA-4B6B-B404-17A020575358.html), which ensures the network performance of vSphere platform. Refer to [example](./docs/usage/install/cloud/get-started-vmware-zh_CN.md)

* Spiderpool underlay network solution could run on public cloud of any vendors, and OpenStack platform, which could meet needs of multi cloud and hybrid cloud with unified CNI stack。refer to [alibabaCloud](./docs/usage/install/cloud/get-started-alibaba-zh_CN.md), [awsCloud](./docs/usage/install/cloud/get-started-aws.md)

* Support shared and exclusive modes in RDMA network cards, and provide RDMA communication devices for applications via Macvlan, IPvlan, and SR-IOV CNI. For more details, please refer to the [example](./docs/usage/rdma.md).

* When starting the Pod, it could help dynamically build the bond interface and vlan interface
  for the master interface of [Macvlan CNI](https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/tree/main/plugins/main/macvlan),
  [ipvlan CNI](https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/tree/main/plugins/main/ipvlan).
  See [example](./docs/usage/ifacer.md) for details.

* coordinator can reconfigure MAC addresses according to the IP address of the NIC. This prevents updating ARP forwarding rules in network switches and routers to reduce packet loss. Refer to the [article](./docs/usage/coordinator.md#fix-mac-address-prefix-for-pods) for more details.

* It could specify customized routes by IP pool and pod annotation. See [example](./docs/usage/route.md) for details.

* Easy generation of [Multus](https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/multus-cni) NetworkAttachmentDefinition
  custom resources with best-practice CNI configuration, also ensure well formatted JSON
  to improve experience. See [example](./docs/concepts/multusconfig.md) for details.

* Multiple IP pools can be set for the application for prevent IP address from running out.
  See [example](./docs/usage/ippool-multi.md) for details.

* Set reserved IPs that will not be assigned to Pods, it can avoid misusing IP addresses
  already taken by hosts out of the cluster. See [example](./docs/usage/reserved-ip.md) for details.

* Outstanding performance for assigning and releasing Pod IPs, showcased in the
 [test report](./docs/concepts/performance.md).

* Well-designed IP reclaim mechanism could help assign IP address in time and
  quickly recover from the breakdown for the cluster or application.
  See [example](./docs/usage/gc.md) for details.

* All above features can work in ipv4-only, ipv6-only, and dual-stack scenarios.
  See [example](./docs/usage/ipv6.md) for details.
